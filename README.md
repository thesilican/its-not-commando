# It's Not Commando

## **Notice:** I don't really plan on updating this library any further, it will not be updated for discord.js versions beyond v12 - I suggest you find another discord command framework to use.

<hr/>

`its-not-commando` is a simple discord.js command framework that is feature-light and
simple to use. In terms of design, it's pretty similar to [discord.js-commando][commando].

Personally, I use this framework in all of my discord.js projects.

## Features

- **Easy to use command system**
  - Using modern javascript `async`/`await`
- **Sophisticated argument system**
  - Arguments can have basic types: Integer, Float, String
  - Optional arguments with default values
  - Multi-arguments that take multiple split values
  - Support for sub-commands!
- **Utility functions for creating prompts**
  - Prompts can be text based or reaction-based
- **Built-in help, shutdown, and ping commands**
- **Fully documentedâ„¢**
